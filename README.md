# bellybutton-challenge
For this activity, we were tasked  with analysing data from a collection of microbes that colonize human navels. First we used d3 to read in the samples, then created a horizontal bar chart that showed the Top 10 Bacteria cultures found in an individual. Then we created a bubble chart that displayed the number of bacteria cultures per sample. Lastly, we created an html tag called 'sample metadata' which loops through the key-value pairs to diplay the demographic information for the participants. We used the drop down menu function on the html page to allow viewers to cycle through different test subjects.
